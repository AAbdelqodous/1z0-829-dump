Which two modifications enable the code to print Open Close?

    A. Replace line n1 with:
        class Folder extends Closeable {
    B. Replace line n1 with:
        class Folder implements AutoCloseable {
    C. At line n2, insert:
         @Override
         public void close() throws IOException {
             System.out.println("Close ");
         }
    D. Replace line n1 with:
        class Folder extends Exception {
    E. At line n2, insert:
        final void close() {
            System.out.println("Close ");
        }

Ans.
    (B., C.)

Community:
    A   is wrong cuz both Closeable and AutoCloseable are "interfaces", not classes.
        Therefore, the "implements" keyword must be used.
    D   wrong. the fact that it is "final" and does not throw anything is fine,
        but it is missing the "public" keyword. trying to compile without "public" gives this error:
        "attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public"
