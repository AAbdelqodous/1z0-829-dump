Java SE 17 Developer (Exam 1Z0-829) Programmer's Guide:
    !a  Inverts a booleanâ€™s logical value
    ~b  Inverts all 0s and 1s in a number, It can only be applied to integer numeric types such as
        byte, short, char, int, and long.
        to find the bitwise complement of a number, multiply it by negative one and then subtract one


    a && b  Value is true only if both values are true. If the left side is false, then the right side will not be evaluated
    a & b                                               If the left side is false, then the right side will be evaluated
    c || d  Value is true if at least one of the values is true. If the left side is true, then the right side will not be evaluated.
    c | d                                                        If the left side is true, then the right side will not be evaluated.
