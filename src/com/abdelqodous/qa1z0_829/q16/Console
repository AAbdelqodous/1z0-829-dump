    B. Console console = System.console();

Java SE 17 Developer (Exam 1Z0-829) Programmer's Guide:
    The java.io.Console class is specifically designed to handle user interactions. After
    all, System.in and System.out are just raw streams, whereas Console is a class with
    numerous methods centered around user input.
    The Console class is a singleton because it is accessible only from a factory method and
    only one instance of it is created by the JVM.

    Console console = System.console();
    if (console != null) {
       String userInput = console.readLine();
       console.writer().println("You entered: " + userInput);
    } else {
       System.err.println("Console not available");
    }

    If it is available, the program retrieves a line of input from the user and prints the result.
