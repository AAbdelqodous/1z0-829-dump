Java SE 17 Developer (Exam 1Z0-829) Programmer's Guide:
    A named module is one containing a module-info.java file. It appear on the module path rather than the classpath.
    An automatic module appears on the module path but does not contain a module-info.java file.
    An unnamed module appears on the classpath.Like an automatic module, it is a regular JAR.
                                               Unlike an automatic module, it is on the classpath rather than the module path.

    Unnamed modules do not export any packages to named or automatic modules.
    The unnamed module can read from any JARs on the classpath or module path.
