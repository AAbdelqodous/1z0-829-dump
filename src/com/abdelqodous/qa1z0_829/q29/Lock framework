Java SE 17 Developer (Exam 1Z0-829) Programmer's Guide:
    The Lock interface is pretty easy to use. When you need to protect a piece of code from multithreaded
    processing, create an instance of Lock that all threads have access to.

    void lock()         Requests lock and blocks until lock is acquired. (Do not return any value)
    boolean tryLock()   Requests lock and returns immediately. Returns boolean indicating whether lock was successfully acquired.
                        attempt to acquire a lock and immediately return a boolean result indicating whether the lock was obtained.
    boolean tryLock(
    long timeout,
    TimeUnit unit)      Requests lock and blocks for specified time or until lock is acquired.
                        Returns boolean indicating whether lock was successfully acquired.
