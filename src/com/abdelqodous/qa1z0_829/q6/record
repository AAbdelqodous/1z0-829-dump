Java SE 17 Developer (Exam 1Z0-829) Programmer's Guide:
    While you can add methods, static fields, and other data types, you cannot add instance
    fields outside the record declaration, even if they are private. Doing so defeats the purpose
    of using a record and could break immutability.
    Records also do not support instance initializers. All initialization for the fields of a
    record must happen in a constructor.
