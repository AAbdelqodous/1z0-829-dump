Gemini:
    if (cobj instanceof B v): This checks if the object referenced by
    cobj (which is actually a C object) is an instance of class B.
    Since C inherits from B, the condition is true.
    The instanceof also performs a pattern matching,
    assigning the reference of the object to the variable v of type B.

    if (v instanceof C v1): This is another instanceof check,
    but now it verifies if v (which refers to the C object) is an instance of C.
    This is again true, and pattern matching assigns the reference to v1 of type C.
