Java SE 17 Developer (Exam 1Z0-829) Programmer's Guide:
    The groupingBy() collector tells collect() that it should group all of the elements of
    the stream into a Map. The function determines the keys in the Map. Each value in the Map is
    a List of all entries that match that key.
    Note that the function you call in groupingBy() cannot return null. It
    does not allow null keys.

    Thereâ€™s another method signature that lets us pass a downstream collector.
        Collectors.groupingBy( String::length, Collectors.toSet())); // {3=[car], 5=[truck], 7=[bicycle], 10=[motorcycle]}
