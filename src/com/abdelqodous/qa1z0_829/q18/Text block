Community:
    The first comparison is true because myStr and myTextBlk1 are equal
    (text block doesn't include trailing new lines if there is no content after the last quote).
    The second and third comparisons are false because myTextBlk2 includes a newline character at the end,
    making it different from myStr and myTextBlk1.
    The last comparison is false because,
    despite interning, myTextBlk1 and myTextBlk2 are not equal due to the newline character in myTextBlk2.
