Which action enables the code to compile?

    A. Replace 2 with static String name;
    B. Replace 7 with public static void display(String design) {
    C. Replace 3 with private static void display() {
    D. Replace 15 with Item.display("Flower");

Ans.
    (A.)

Community:
    static methods cannot access instance variable unless they are static. That is to say:
    - either the "name" variable must be made static so that it can be accessed by the display() method on line 3
    - or the display() method on line 3 must be made non-static (remove the static keyword) so that it can access the "name" variable
    Only alternative that achieves one of these two is A.

    Note that despite this change, i1.display("Flower") will still call the display() method on line 7.
    Non-static methods are allowed to access static instance variable regardless. In this case,
    since both "this.name" and "name" are null, "this.name += name;" will simply do "null += null;"
    and the result will be "nullnull".
